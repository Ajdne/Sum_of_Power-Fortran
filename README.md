## About the program
Before understanding the program, the theoretical background of Power systems and its analysis is required.  
There are some good sources which explain power flow analasys in-depth. To view them, click [here](https://electrisim.com/load-flow-power-flow.html) or [here](https://www.intechopen.com/books/computational-models-in-engineering/power-flow-analysis).

**Main.f90**

**Setup.txt** contains:
 - **Units_Selector** - Selection of units of length (meters or feet)\
 - **Max_Iter** - Maximum number of iterations (needed in case the program is not able to reach the solution)\
 - **Epsilon** - Iteration criteria value\

**Grid_Layout.txt** contains:
 - **Number_of_Nodes** - Total number of nodes in the given power grid\
 - **Number_of_Consumer_Nodes** - Number of nodes with some power consumption (where apparent power S is not 0)\

**Power_Line_Parameters.txt** contains:
 - **Zd** - Line impedance value represented as direct(positive) symmetrical component\
 - **Y0** - Power line admittance value\
  Units of **Zd** and **Y0** are [ Î© / unit of length] and [ mS / unit of length], respectively.\
 - **S[i]** - Real and imaginary part of apparent power of each consumer node, where "i" represents the consumer node index\
 - **V1** - Line voltage value in root node\
 - **Sb** - Base value of apparent power\
  This value is needed for normalisation procedures (converting all units into relative values, so calculations are done more easly...).

**Predmetni_projekat.pdf** is additional documentation written in Serbian language explaining the theoretical background of the Power systems and this calculation.
